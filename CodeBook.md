CodeBook for Peer Assessment Course Project

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
 
- SubjectID: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Activity: Its activity label.
- 561-feature with time and frequency domain variables (Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.)
